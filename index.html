              <p class="subtitle">I am an traditionally trained allopathic medical doctor licensed by the Arizona Board of Homeopathic and Integrated Medicine Examiners.
                While I can and do prescribe traditional medications, I focus on the whole person utilizing a whole health approach to prevention, health, and well-being 
                employing a biological framework to find and treat the root causes of a disease or disorder creating a personalized patient care plan and an individualized 
                medical experience. This means I may recommend dietary changes and supplements along with or instead of medications. <br><br>The functional medicine model of care offers a patient-centered approach to chronic disease management. My approach seeks 
                to answer the question, “Why are you ill?”, not just "take this pill". <br><br>You receive personalized and effective care. My philosophy of medical care
                uses a frame work for understanding wholeness and health, utilizing a combination of conventional medication, nutrition, supplements, along with education and personalized counseling.</p>
